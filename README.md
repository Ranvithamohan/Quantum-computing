Introduction

Quantum computing is a paradigm of computation based on the principles of quantum mechanics, in which information can be processed and encoded using more complex data structures (requiring traversal not only 0/1 states) than those for classical computer. The presentation is created to explain basic knowledge of quantum mechanics, what lies behind a structure of the computer and some key algorithms along with practical applications powered by this upcoming technology.
